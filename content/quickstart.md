You've used loggers before. Here's how to get on the air with Carrier Wave.

## Download & First Launch

[Download Carrier Wave from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/carrier-wave). On first launch, the app will ask for location permission to automatically determine your grid square.

## Connect Your Services

Open **Settings** (gear icon) and scroll to **Services**. Connect at least one:

| Service | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **QRZ.com** | General logbook, callsign lookups |
| **POTA** | Park activation uploads |
| **Ham2K LoFi** | Cross-device sync |
| **LoTW** | Confirmation downloads |
| **HAMRS** | HAMRS cloud sync |

Start with QRZ - enter your username and password. The app stores credentials securely in the iOS Keychain.

## Log Your First QSO

1. Tap the **Logger** tab
2. Set your session: band, mode, frequency
3. Enter the callsign - QRZ lookup happens automatically
4. Enter RST sent/received
5. Tap **Save**

That's it. Your QSO is logged locally and queued for sync.

{{< callout "tip" "Quick Entry Mode" >}}
For rapid logging, enable Quick Entry in the Logger. Type everything in one line:
`K6TEST 599 CA` (callsign, RST, state)
{{< /callout >}}

## Verify Sync

Check the **Dashboard** tab. Service status indicators show:

- **Green**: Synced and current
- **Yellow**: Sync in progress
- **Red**: Sync error (tap for details)

If you see issues, check [Troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting/).
