The Dashboard gives you an at-a-glance view of your logging activity and service status.

## Activity Statistics

The top of the Dashboard shows your QSO statistics in a grid:

### By Band
How many contacts on each band (20m, 40m, 2m, etc.). Tap any band to drill down and see those specific contacts.

### By Mode
Contacts broken down by mode (SSB, CW, FT8, FM). See where you spend most of your time.

### By Country
Your DXCC entity count. Working toward 100 countries for the {{< term "DXCC" >}} award? Track your progress here.

### Other Stats
- **Grid Squares** - Unique grids worked
- **Parks** - POTA parks worked or activated
- **States** - Progress toward WAS

## Streaks

Below the stats grid, you'll see your current streak - how many consecutive days you've logged at least one contact. Gamification for radio!

## Service Status

The Services section shows sync status for each connected service:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Green dot** | Synced and current |
| **Yellow dot** | Sync in progress |
| **Red dot** | Error (tap for details) |
| **Gray dot** | Not configured |

Tap any service to see details about the last sync, pending uploads, or error messages.

## Drill-Down Views

Tap any statistic to see the underlying contacts:

- Tap "40m: 127" to see all your 40 meter contacts
- Tap "CW: 45" to see your Morse code QSOs
- Tap a country to see all contacts with that DXCC entity

This makes it easy to find specific contacts or review your activity in a particular area.

## Background Computation

Statistics are computed in the background to keep the app responsive. When you first open the Dashboard after logging many contacts, you might see a progress indicator as stats update.
