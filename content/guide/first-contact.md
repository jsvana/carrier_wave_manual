You've set up the app. Now let's log a contact.

## Open the Logger

Tap the **Logger** tab at the bottom of the screen. You'll see the main logging interface.

## Set Your Session

Before logging, set your session parameters at the top of the screen:

1. **Band** - Tap to select (e.g., 20m, 40m, 2m)
2. **Mode** - Tap to select (e.g., SSB, CW, FM)
3. **Frequency** - Enter your operating frequency (optional but helpful)

These settings persist until you change them, so you don't need to set them for every contact.

## Enter the Contact

Now you're ready to log:

### 1. Callsign

Tap the callsign field and enter the other station's call. As you type:
- Carrier Wave searches QRZ for matching calls
- When found, their name, location, and grid appear automatically

### 2. RST Sent / RST Received

Enter the signal reports you exchanged:
- **RST Sent** - The report you gave them
- **RST Received** - The report they gave you

Default is 59/59 for voice, 599/599 for CW.

### 3. Optional Fields

Expand additional fields if needed:
- **Name** - Their name (often auto-filled from QRZ)
- **State/Province** - Their state or province
- **Park** - If they're a POTA activator, enter the park reference
- **Notes** - Anything memorable about the contact

### 4. Save

Tap **Save QSO** (or the checkmark button).

That's it! Your contact is:
- Saved locally to your device
- Queued for sync to your connected services
- Visible in your Logs tab

## Watch It Sync

Switch to the **Dashboard** tab. You'll see your services listed with status indicators. Within a few seconds (depending on network conditions), your QSO syncs to the cloud.

## Duplicate Detection

If you log the same station twice on the same band and date, Carrier Wave shows a duplicate warning. This helps avoid accidental double-logging.

Different band? Different date? No warning - those are valid separate contacts.

## What's Next?

Congratulations on your first logged QSO! Next, let's explore [your Dashboard](/guide/dashboard/) to understand your statistics.
