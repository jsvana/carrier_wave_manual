Challenges are community events that encourage specific types of operating activity.

## Browsing Challenges

Open the **Challenges** tab to see available challenges:

- Active challenges you can join
- Your current challenge participation
- Completed challenges

## Challenge Types

Challenges vary in their goals:

- **QSO count** - Log X contacts in a time period
- **Band challenges** - Work specific bands
- **Mode challenges** - Focus on CW, digital, etc.
- **Geographic** - Work specific states, countries, grids
- **POTA** - Activate or hunt parks

## Joining a Challenge

1. Browse available challenges
2. Tap a challenge for details
3. Tap **Join** to participate

Your existing QSOs may count retroactively if they meet the challenge criteria.

## Progress Tracking

Once joined, the challenge card shows:

- Your current progress (QSOs, points, etc.)
- Goal and percentage complete
- Time remaining
- Rank among participants

## Leaderboards

Each challenge has a leaderboard showing:

- Top participants
- Your rank
- Points or QSO counts

Leaderboards update as participants log contacts.

## Challenge Rules

Each challenge defines:

- **Start/end dates** - When QSOs count
- **Qualifying criteria** - What makes a QSO count
- **Scoring** - How points are calculated
- **Categories** - Different entry classes

Read rules carefully - not all QSOs may count.

## Automatic Tracking

Carrier Wave automatically tracks your progress:

1. Log QSOs normally
2. App checks against challenge rules
3. Qualifying QSOs count toward your total

No special logging mode required.

Past challenges remain visible:

- Your final standing
